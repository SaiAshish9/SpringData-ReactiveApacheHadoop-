```
Reactive programming is driven by events and focuses on the flow of data
in a non-blocking, asynchronous way. Reactive programming is the foundation 
of Spring WebFlux, an alternative way of developing web applications.
Spring WebFlux makes it possible to build reactive applications on the HTTP layer.

Mono is more relatable to the Optional class in Java since it contains 0 or 1 value,
and Flux is more relatable to List since it can have N number of values.
